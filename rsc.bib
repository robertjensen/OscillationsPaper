  abstract = {A novel microfabricated chemical reactor for highly sensitive measurements
	of catalytic activity and surface kinetics is presented. The reactor
	is fabricated in a silicon chip and is intended for gas-phase reactions
	at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 bar. A high sensitivity is obtained
	by directing the entire gas flow through the catalyst bed to a mass
	spectrometer, thus ensuring that nearly all reaction products are
	present in the analyzed gas flow. Although the device can be employed
	for testing a wide range of catalysts, the primary aim of the design
	is to allow characterization of model catalysts which can only be
	obtained in small quantities. Such measurements are of significant
	fundamental interest but are challenging because of the low surface
	areas involved. The relationship between the reaction zone gas flow
	and the pressure in the reaction zone is investigated experimentally.
	A corresponding theoretical model is presented, and the gas flow
	through an on-chip flow-limiting capillary is predicted to be in
	the intermediate regime. The experimental data for the gas flow are
	found to be in good agreement with the theoretical model. At typical
	experimental conditions, the total gas flow through the reaction
	zone is around 3 x 10(14) molecules s(-1), corresponding to a gas
	residence time in the reaction zone of about 11 s. To demonstrate
	the operation of the microreactor, CO oxidation on low-area platinum
	thin film circles is employed as a test reaction. Using temperature
	ramping, it is found that platinum catalysts with areas as small
	as 15 mu m(2) are conveniently characterized with the device. (C)

  abstract = {Reaction-rate oscillations in CO oxidation on platinum catalysts at
	atmospheric pressure are believed to depend on a mechanism which
	blocks adsorption by the reactants. Two proposed models, the oxidation-reduction
	and carbon models, explain the oscillations based on different site-blocking
	chemical species, and both describe the observed phenomena relatively
	well. A series of tests is described which was designed to use the
	differences between these models in order to determine which model
	best describes the observed behavior. In these tests, a platinum
	thin-film catalyst is first exposed to only one of the reactants.
	The second reactant is then added, and the transient response of
	the system is measured. From this test, it is found that while neither
	model predicts completely the initial transients, the oxidation-reduction
	model agrees best with the experimental results. The transient behavior
	from these tests and its implications are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier
