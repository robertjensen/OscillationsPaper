	promotion of catalysis was used to initiate and stop the oscillatory

	the oscillatory behaviours. An extremely small negative current (-17
	mu A) led to a 4-fold increase of the catalytic activity and created
	oscillations that were stable even after current interruption. This
	permanent effect in the oscillatory behaviour of CO oxidation rate
	is observed for the first time using EPOC. This has been interpreted
	by the higher tendency of the nanometric-Pt particles to form PtO(x)
	in thin sputtered films. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Kinetic oscillation is produced when fast carbon monoxide oxidation

	Different effects are investigated on synchronization, including
	thermal conduction efficiency, heat dissipation efficiency, and distance
	between the two oscillators. Decreasing thermal conduction efficiency
	isolates each kinetically oscillating catalyst and results in complicated
	oscillation patterns. Heat dissipation has the opposite influence
	on synchronization comparing to thermal conduction. Low heat dissipation
	from the substrate to the environment maintains the temperature of
	the system and thus promotes synchronization. In addition, synchronization
	is destroyed when the distance between two oscillating particles
	becomes several-fold longer than the platinum particle size.},
