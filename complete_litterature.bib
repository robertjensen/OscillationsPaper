	up to 625 K. Depending on the O-2/CO pressure ratio, we find three
	well-defined structures: namely, (i) the bulk-terminated Pt(110)
	surface, (ii) a thin, commensurate oxide, and (iii) a thin, incommensurate
	oxide. The commensurate oxide only appears under reaction conditions,
	i.e., when both O-2 and CO are present and at sufficiently high temperatures.
	Density functional theory calculations indicate that the commensurate
	oxide is stabilized by carbonate ions (CO32-). Both oxides have a
	substantially higher catalytic activity than the bulk-terminated

	show that this sub-surface oxygen layer does not lower the activity
	of such platinum surface towards CO oxidation. Therefore, while sub-surface
	oxygen layer does form under catalytically relevant temperatures
	on Pt(111), it has no great influence on the oxidizing ability of
	such surface. This sheds new light on the initial stages of platinum

  abstract = {Water, one of the most popular species in our planet, can play a catalytic
	role in many reactions, including reactions in heterogeneous catalysis.
	In a recent experimental work, Bergeld, Kasemo, and Chakarov demonstrated
	that water is able to promote CO oxidation under low temperatures
	(similar to200 K). In this study, we choose CO oxidation on Pt(111)
	in the presence of water as a model system to address the catalytic
	role of water for surface reactions in general using density functional
	theory. Many elementary steps possibly involved in the CO oxidation
	on Pt(111) at low temperatures have been investigated. We find the
	following. First, in the presence of water, the CO oxidation barrier
	is reduced to 0.33 eV (without water the barrier is 0.80 eV). This
	barrier reduction is mainly due to the H-bonding between the H in
	the H2O and the O at the transition state (TS), which stabilizes
	the TS. Second, CO can readily react with OH with a barrier of 0.44
	eV, while COOH dissociation to produce CO2 is not easy (the barrier
	is 1.02 eV). Third, in the H2O+OH mixed phase, CO can be easily converted
	into CO2. It occurs through two steps: CO reacts with OH, forming
	COOH; and COOH transfers the H to a nearby H2O and, at the same time,
	an H in the H2O transfers to a OH, leading to CO2 formation. The
	reaction barrier of this process is 0.60 eV under CO coverage of
	1/6 ML and 0.33 eV under CO coverage of 1/3 ML. The mechanism of
	CO oxidation at low temperatures is discussed. On the basis of our
	calculations, we propose that the water promotion effect can in general
	be divided into two classes: (i) By H-bonding between the H of H2O
	and an electron negative species such as the O in the reaction of
	CO+O+H2O-->CO2+H2O, H2O can stabilize the TS of the reaction and
	hence reduce the barrier. (ii) H2O first dissociates into H and OH
	and then OH or H participates directly in the reaction to induce
	new reaction mechanism with more favorable routes, in which OH or
	H can act as an intermediate. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

	pressures, using a combined flow reactor and scanning tunneling microscope
	(STM). By switching from a CO-rich flow to an O2-rich flow, and vice
	versa, we could reversibly oxidize and reduce the surface, as we
	have observed with the STM. Both during the initial oxidation and
	during the catalytic reaction on the oxide, the surface became rough.
	Coinciding with the formation of the palladium oxide there was a
	step up in the CO oxidation rate. Whereas the reaction rate on the
	metallic surface followed traditional Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetics,
	the reaction rate on the oxide was proportional to the CO-pressure
	and did not depend on the O2-pressure. We suggest that the high reaction
	rate on the oxide resulted from the low stability of the oxide, making
	it highly reactive, and that the reaction followed the Mars–Van Krevelen
	mechanism, in which the oxide is continually ‘consumed’ and reformed.
	The switching between the metallic surface and the oxide showed significant
	hysteresis in the CO-pressure for O2-rich conditions. This resulted
	in a CO-pressure window where reaction was stable both on the metal
	and on the oxide. We have observed that the reaction switched spontaneously
	between these branches, leading to oscillations in the reaction rate.
	Our interpretation is in strong disagreement with well-established
	models for CO oxidation on Pt-group metal surfaces.},

	particles. Non-isothermal kinetics caused by local overheating provides
	an extra thermal conduction channel for synchronization between oscillators.
	Kinetic oscillation is produced when fast carbon monoxide oxidation
	is accompanied with slow subsurface oxygen formation and removal.
	Different effects are investigated on synchronization, including
	thermal conduction efficiency, heat dissipation efficiency, and distance
	between the two oscillators. Decreasing thermal conduction efficiency
	isolates each kinetically oscillating catalyst and results in complicated
	oscillation patterns. Heat dissipation has the opposite influence
	on synchronization comparing to thermal conduction. Low heat dissipation
	from the substrate to the environment maintains the temperature of
	the system and thus promotes synchronization. In addition, synchronization
	is destroyed when the distance between two oscillating particles
	becomes several-fold longer than the platinum particle size.},
