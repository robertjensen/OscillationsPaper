	site of PtO2(110) reacts with CO on the coordinatively unsaturated
	site (CUS) with a negligible barrier; (ii) O-2 adsorbs on the bridge
	site and then interacts with CO on the CUS to form an OO-CO complex;
	(iii) the bond of O-OCO breaks to produce CO2 with a small barrier
	(0.01 eV). The CO oxidation mechanisms on metals and metal oxides
	are rationalized by a simple model: The O-surface bonding determines
	the reactivity on surfaces; it also determines whether the atomic
	or molecular mechanism is preferred. The reactivity on metal oxides
	is further found to be related to the 3rd ionization energy of the

	influence the reaction by 'poisoning' it or by acting as the catalytically

	during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide. Here, we present
	operando X-ray diffraction experiments on a palladium surface during
	this reaction. They reveal that a high density of steps strongly
	alters the stability of the thin, catalytically active palladium

  abstract = {This article focuses on the microscopic origin of oscillations in
	the rate of CO oxidation at atmospheric pressures on Pt group metals.
	We start by briefly reviewing several existing models for oscillatory
	CO oxidation on such Surfaces at pressures ranging from ultrahigh
	vacuum to several bar. We describe our observations for this reaction
	on Pt(110) and Pd(100) at atmospheric pressures obtained with a scanning
	tunnelling microscope inside a microflow reactor. The combination
	of STM movies and the simultaneously determined partial pressures
	and reaction rate reveals that by switching between a CO-rich flow
	and an O-2-rich flow. and vice versa, we can reversibly oxidize and
	reduce the Pt and Pd surfaces. We find that on both surfaces the
	formation of the oxide, seen in the STM images, is accompanied by
	a stepwise increase in the reaction rate and a change in the reaction
	mechanism. The switching between the reduced metal and the surface
	oxide exhibits significant hysteresis as a function of CO pressure
	and for both Pt and Pd there exists a CO pressure window in which
	both the metal and tile oxide state are stable. This bistabililty
	leads to spontaneous reaction oscillations on Pd( 1 0 0). Under Our
	atmospheric conditions thew oscillations are not due to the 'familiar'
	bistability in Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics, in contrast with common
	'wisdom'. Instead, tile high-pressure reaction oscillations reflect
	the periodic switching between the low-reactivity metallic surface
	and the high-reactivity oxide surface, Our results show further that
	effects that are held responsible for low-pressure reaction oscillations
	are not relevant at atmospheric pressure. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All

  abstract = {A novel microfabricated chemical reactor for highly sensitive measurements
	of catalytic activity and surface kinetics is presented. The reactor
	is fabricated in a silicon chip and is intended for gas-phase reactions
	at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 bar. A high sensitivity is obtained
	by directing the entire gas flow through the catalyst bed to a mass
	spectrometer, thus ensuring that nearly all reaction products are
	present in the analyzed gas flow. Although the device can be employed
	for testing a wide range of catalysts, the primary aim of the design
	is to allow characterization of model catalysts which can only be
	obtained in small quantities. Such measurements are of significant
	fundamental interest but are challenging because of the low surface
	areas involved. The relationship between the reaction zone gas flow
	and the pressure in the reaction zone is investigated experimentally.
	A corresponding theoretical model is presented, and the gas flow
	through an on-chip flow-limiting capillary is predicted to be in
	the intermediate regime. The experimental data for the gas flow are
	found to be in good agreement with the theoretical model. At typical
	experimental conditions, the total gas flow through the reaction
	zone is around 3 x 10(14) molecules s(-1), corresponding to a gas
	residence time in the reaction zone of about 11 s. To demonstrate
	the operation of the microreactor, CO oxidation on low-area platinum
	thin film circles is employed as a test reaction. Using temperature
	ramping, it is found that platinum catalysts with areas as small
	as 15 mu m(2) are conveniently characterized with the device. (C)

	the influence of global coupling via the gas phase concentration

	appears to be spatially nonuniform. A simple discrete model, a set

	captures qualitatively the experimentally observed behavior. (C)

  abstract = {Reaction-rate oscillations in CO oxidation on platinum catalysts at
	atmospheric pressure are believed to depend on a mechanism which
	blocks adsorption by the reactants. Two proposed models, the oxidation-reduction
	and carbon models, explain the oscillations based on different site-blocking
	chemical species, and both describe the observed phenomena relatively
	well. A series of tests is described which was designed to use the
	differences between these models in order to determine which model
	best describes the observed behavior. In these tests, a platinum
	thin-film catalyst is first exposed to only one of the reactants.
	The second reactant is then added, and the transient response of
	the system is measured. From this test, it is found that while neither
	model predicts completely the initial transients, the oxidation-reduction
	model agrees best with the experimental results. The transient behavior
	from these tests and its implications are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier

	nm were soft-landed onto HOPG surfaces using a gas-aggregation source
	and (2) nanoparticles were formed by e-beam evaporation of Ru films
	onto HOPG. The particles generated by the gas-aggregation source
	are round in shape with evidence of facets resolved on the larger
	particles. Annealing these nanoparticles when they are supported
	on unsputtered HOPG resulted in the sintering of smaller nanoparticles,
	while larger particles remained immobile. Nanoparticles deposited

	when annealed. The size and shape of nanoparticles deposited by e-beam

	support and the temperature. Ru deposition onto unsputtered HOPG
	is characterised by bimodal growth with large flat particles formed
	on the substrate terraces and smaller diameter particles aligned
	along the substrate steps. Evaporation onto sputtered HOPG results
	in the formation of 2 nm round particles with a narrow size distribution.
	Finally, thermal deposition onto both sputtered and unsputtered HOPG

  abstract = {We present Monte Carlo simulations of kinetic oscillations in the
	CO-O-2 reaction occurring on a (10 0) facet of a nm-sized supported
	Pt particle. The model includes the conventional Langmuir-Hinshelwood
	mechanism of CO oxidation and CO- and O-induced restructuring of
	the facet. The facet size is varied from 50 x 50 to 5 x 5. With decreasing
	size, oscillations become more irregular. More or less regular oscillations
	accompanied by formation of CO islands are found for the sizes down
	to 15 x 15. Practically, this means that for observation of such
	oscillations the particle diameter should be above similar or equal
	to4 nm. These findings are in agreement with available experimental
	data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
