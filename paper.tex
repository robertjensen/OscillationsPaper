Because of its industrial importance CO oxidation on transition metal surfaces has been widely studied as both industrial catalyst and as a model system for testing catalytic properties of materials (REF, Ertl?). Despite intensive studies this reaction is still not understood and shows interesting new and interesting features. 

It has previously been shown that CO oxidation will show oscillatory behavior on single crystals on palladium \cite{Hendriksen2010} attributed to a cycle of surface oxide formation, oxide roughening and bare metal surface. CO oxidation oscillations on has also been observed on thin-films \cite{Lund2000} and in macroscopic flow reactors \cite{Singh2010} but never on size selected platinum nanoparticles at atmospheric pressures for prolonged periods of time.

\section{Experimental Methods}
\subsection{$\mu$-reactors}
Reaction data was performed in silicon-based microreactors developed in-house \cite{Henriksen2009}. The reactor consists of two inlets, a long mixing zone for the reaction gases to allow for diffusional mixing, an outlet, a reactor volume of $240\,$nL and a $5.4\,\mu$m wide capillary used for probing the gases from the reactor volume. The reactor is sealed from atmosphere by anodic bonding a pyrex lid to the silicon reactor, it is able to operate at a pressure range of 0-2.5\,bar. The reaction gases is supplied through flow controllers capable of controlling flow in the range of 0-10 mL/min. The capillary flow is fed into a quadropole mass-spectrometer while any extra gas from the inlets are passed directly through to the outlet connected to a pressure controller to control the reactor pressure. The design ensures that all gas exposed to the catalyst under investigation is measured by the mass spectrometer ensuring a high sensitivity of the device. When an evacuated microreactor is mounted, the base pressure of the mass spectrometer chamber is $\sim5\times10^{-9}\,$mbar and when operating at $1\,$bar in the reactor the pressure is $\sim5\times10^{-7}\,$mbar.

The reactor is heated by joule heating of platinum strip evaporated on the backside of the reactor volume. The introduction of two additional contacts on the backside of the reactor allows for 4 wire measurements of the resistance of the platinum strip using it as a RTD for temperature measurement of the reactor volume. An external thermocouple acts as room-temperature calibration of the RTD as well as sanity check of the RTD measurement doing operation.

The system is fully automized, allowing for measurements of several days without human intervention. This allows for very self-consistent measurements of many samples.

A typical oscillation maesurement is done by mounting a sample in setup directly after cluster deposition and anodic bonding. A typical measurement will involve an initial light-off CO-oxidation measurement, where the temperature is slowly increased up until the sample ignites and achieves full conversion of the CO. At the typical conditions (O:CO ratio of typically $\sim13$ and Pt-coverage of $\sim0.1\%$) lighoff happens around 180$^\circ$C, the ramp is typically continued up to 260$^\circ$C whereafter the temperature is lowered at the same rate as the heating (typically 3$^\circ$C/min). A typical initial treatment is seen in figurefigure~\ref{fgr:initial_treatment} Often the sample will show oscillations either directly upon lightoff or on the falling temperature ramp. Sustained oscillations is then achieved by following the same heathing ramp up to a fixed temperature and then the temperature is kept constant for the remaing period of the measurement.

\subsection{Platinum nanoparticle deposition}
Platinum nanoparticles were deposited from a size-selected cluster source (REF!). Clusters are produced by impinging argon ions on a metal target and condensing these in a cold gas. The cluster are subsequently size-selected by a quadropole mass selection filter. Typical sizes are 3-9\,nm and the coverage is kept at approximately 0.1\% geometric coverage determined by measuring the current on the reactor. After deposition the reactor is anodicly cold-bonded \cite{Vesborg2010} to a pyrex lid to avoid sintering of the nanoparticles.

\section{Results}
During the experiments we have tried a large number of samples, and it is evident that the oscillation phenomenon is rather easy to reproduce. In agreement with litterature\cite{Singh2010,Hendriksen2005}, we find that a very high oxygen concentration (on the order of 13:1) is needed to get the oscillations running, most likely because the much higher sticking coefficient of CO would otherwise result in a completely CO poisoned sample doing the low-reactivity region of the cycle. In our setup we also found that we need a very low coverage on the order 0.1\% of nano-particles to achive consistent oscillations. This is for sure an artifact of our very small reactor, since other groups have seen oscillations on both extended thin-films \cite{Singh2010} as well as on single crystals\cite{Hendriksen2005}.

The period of the oscillations ranges from a few seconds (the time-constant of the reactor) up to more than an hour. A slow is oscillation is seen in figure~\ref{fgr:full_oscillation} where we see the typical pattern going from almost no activity slowly up towards $\sim$50\% conversion at which point the sample light off to full conversion almost instantiously where after a short peiod of time the sample again de-activates.

  \includegraphics[width=17cm]{single_full_oscillation.png}
  \caption{A full oscillation first showing a steep ignition of the sample followed by an almost imidiately de-activation of the sample. For the next 65 minutes the sample slowly recovers activity until it again lights off completely.}
  \label{fgr:full_oscillation}
\end{figure*}

Most measurements where done at 1\,bar, however no clear pressure dependence is seen within a pressure range of at least 0.1\,bar to 1\,bar, the oscillations neither change their period nor qualitative behaviour significantly. Similarly, only a rather weak dependence on the CO pressure is seen. Oscillations is barely visible in the mass-spectrometry from a CO-concentration of $\sim0.025$ and is then seen up to concentrations of $\sim0.175$. A tendendcy towards slower oscillations for higher CO-concentrations is seen, but the effect is not very large.

If a sample is leaved at constant temperature for long periods of time, it keeps performing sustained oscillations, but with longer and longer periods. In the beginning the period is very stable and sligtly increasing but after a few days, the periods becomes more and more noisy although still maintaining the trend of longer and longer periods. Figure~\ref{fgr:full_oscillation} shows a summary of the periods of a sample oscillating for 4 days. Analysing the on/off ratio of the oscillations doing the full period of time shows that the ratio is unaffected across the entire period of the measurement, the oscillations are qualititively almost identical even though the period is changed by a factor of 10 doing the measurement.

  \caption{Summary of a sample oscillating under constant temperature, pressure and reactant composition. The sample went through a total of 439 oscillations in 4 days.}
  \label{fgr:long_measurement}
\end{figure}

Extracts of the mass-spectrometry from the very beginning, the middle and towards the end of the experiments is shown in figure~\ref{fgr:extracts}, it is evident that the oscillations are getting more and more irregular as times goes on. Towards the end, it is also clearly visible how  oscillations with smaller amplitude are taking place at a much higher frequency than the full on-off cycles, which is most likely the explanation for the increasing scatter in the period summary, sometimes the smaller oscillations will trigger a full switch, and sometimes it will not, thus introducing more short-period oscillations despite the trend of slower and slower oscillations.

\section{Discussion}
Due to long timescales involved which are much larger than any typically orcurring timescales for such a small system, there can be little doubt that this phenomenon involves some kind of reaction involving the bulk of the nano particles. Due to the nature of our reactor system, it is almost impossible to gain extra insight through traditional surface science techniques, but it has eaelier been showed that in other experimental setups, it is possible to apply both SPM microscopy \cite{Hendriksen2005} as well as infrared spectroscopy \cite{Carlsson2006}.

The exact mechanisum of CO oxidation on Pt is still under debate, but concesus seems to be, that the most active phase is a skin of Pt-oxide on top of metallic Pt. ..... .... ... ...

The phenomenon of increasing oscillation period over time is completely consistent across all measured samples, and it must originate from a real physical phenomen. A possible explanation of the phenomenon could be sintering or roughening of the clusters.
