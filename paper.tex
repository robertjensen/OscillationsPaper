Because of its industrial importance CO oxidation on transition metal surfaces has been widely studied as both industrial catalyst and as a model system for testing catalytic properties of materials (REF, Ertl?). Despite intensive studies this reaction is still not understood and shows interesting new and interesting features. 

It has previously been shown (REF) that CO oxidation will show oscillatory behavior on single crystals on palladium \cite{Hendriksen2010} attributed to a cycle of surface oxide formation, oxide roughening and bare metal surface. CO oxidation oscillations on has also been observed on thin-films \cite{Lund2000} and in macroscopic flow reactors \cite{Singh2010} but never on size selected platinum nanoparticles at atmospheric pressures for prolonged periods of time.

\section{Experimental Methods}
\subsection{$\mu$-reactors}
Reaction data was performed in silicon-based microreactors developed in-house \cite{Henriksen2009}. The reactor consists of a two inlets, a long mixing zone for the reaction gases to allow for diffusional mixing, an outlet, a reactor volume of $240\,$nL and a $5.4\,\mu$m wide capillary used for probing the gases from the reactor volume. The reactor is sealed from atmosphere by anodic bonding of a pyrex lid to the silicon reactor is able to operate at a pressure range of 0-2.5\,bar. The reaction gases is supplied through flow controllers capable of controlling flow in the range of a 1-10 mL/min. The capillary flow fed into a quadropole mass-spectrometer while any extra gas from the inlets are passed through the outlet connected to a pressure controller to control the reactor pressure. The design ensures that all gas exposed to the catalyst under investigation is measured by the mass spectrometer ensuring a high sensitivity of the device. When an evacuated microreactor is mounted, the base pressure of the mass spectrometer chamber is $\sim5\times10^{-9}\,$mbar and when operating at $1\,$bar in the reactor the pressure is $\sim5\times10^{-7}\,$mbar.

The reactor is heated by joule heating of platinum strip evaporated on the backside of the reactor volume. The introduction of two additional contacts on the backside of the reactor allows for 4 wire measurements of the resistance of the platinum strip using it as a RTD for temperature measurement of the reactor volume. 

\subsection{Platinum nanoparticle deposition}
Platinum nanoparticles were deposited from a size-selected cluster source (REF!). Clusters are produced by impinging argon ions on a metal target and condensing these in a cold gas. The cluster are subsequently size-selected by a quadropole mass selection filter. Typical sizes are 3-9\,nm and the coverage is kept at approximately 0.1\% geometric coverage determined by measuring the current on the reactor. After deposition the reactor is anodicly cold-bonded \cite{Vesborg2010} to a pyrex lid to avoid sintering of the nanoparticles.

\section{Results}
The experiments was carried out ....

The period of the oscillations ranges from a few seconds (the time-constant of the reactor) up to more than an hour. A typical slow is oscillation is seen in figure~\ref{fgr:full_oscillation} where we see the typical pattern going from almost no activity slowly up towards $\sim$50\% conversion at which point the sample light off to full conversion almost instantiously where after a short peiod of time the sample again de-activates.

  \includegraphics[width=17cm]{single_full_oscillation.png}
  \caption{A full oscillation first showing a steep ignition of the sample followed by an almost imidiately de-activation of the sample. For the next 65 minutes the sample slowly recovers activity until it again lights off completely.}
  \label{fgr:full_oscillation}
\end{figure*}

If a sample is leaved for long periods of time, it keeps performing sustained oscillations, but with longer and longer periods. In the beginning the period is very stable and sligtly increasing but after a few days, the periods becomes more and more noisy although still maintaining the trend of longer and longer periods. Figure~\ref{fgr:full_oscillation} shows a summary of the periods of a sample oscillating for 4 days.

  \caption{Summary of a sample oscillating under constant temperature, pressure and reactant composition. The sample went through a total of 439 oscillations in 4 days.}
  \label{fgr:long_measurement}
\end{figure}

Extracts of the mass-spectrometry from the very beginning, the middle and towards the end of the experiments is shown in figure~\ref{fgr:extracts}, it is evident that the oscillations are getting more and more irregular as times goes on, towards the end, it is also clearly visible how the smaller oscillations are taking place at a much higher frequency than the full on-off cycles, which is most likely the explanation for the increasing scatter in the period summary.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=9cm]{extracts_from_very_long_oscillation.png}
  \caption{Extracts from the 4 day long experiment.}
  \label{fgr:extracts}
\end{figure}

Several different samples deposited at various diffent sizes and amounts all show the oscillating bahaviour. Repeatability is high regarding running long experiments on a single sample, but very low from sample to sample.

\section{Discussion}
Due to long timescales involved which are much larger than any typically orcurring timescales for such a small system, there can be little doubt that this phenomenon involves some kind of reaction involving the bulk of the nano particles.




%\subsection{This is the subsection heading style}
%Section headings can be typeset with and without numbers.\cite{Gong2004} \cite{Hendriksen2010}

%\subsubsection{This is the subsubsection style.~~} These headings should end in a full point.  

%\paragraph{This is the next level heading.~~} For this level please use \texttt{\textbackslash paragraph}. These headings should also end in a full point.

\section{Equations}

Equations can be typeset inline \textit{e.g.} $ y = mx + c$ or displayed with and without numbers:

 \[ A = \pi r^2 \]

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{\gamma}}{\mathrm{\epsilon}x} r^2 = 2r
\end{equation}

\section{Graphics and tables}
\subsection{Graphics}
Graphics should be inserted on the page where they are first mentioned (unless they are equations, which appear in the flow of the text).



\subsection{Tables}
Tables typeset in RSC house style do not include vertical lines. Table footnote symbols are lower-case italic letters and are typeset at the bottom of the table. Table captions do not end in a full point.


\begin{table}[h]
\small
  \caption{\ An example of a caption to accompany a table}
  \label{tbl:example}
  \begin{tabular*}{0.5\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lll}
    \hline
    Header one/units & Header two & Header three \\
    \hline
    1 & 2 & 3 \\
    4 & 5 & 6 \\
    7 & 8 & 9 \\
    10 & 11 & 12 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular*}
\end{table}

Adding notes to tables can be complicated.  Perhaps the easiest
method is to generate these manually.

You can also put lists into the text. You can have bulleted or numbered lists of almost any kind. 
The \texttt{mhchem} package can also be used so
that formulae are easy to input: \texttt{\textbackslash ce\{H2SO4\}} gives \ce{H2SO4}. 


\section{Conclusions}
The conclusions section should come at the end of article. For the reference section, the style file rsc.bst can be used to generate the correct reference style.\footnote[4]{Footnotes should appear here. These might include comments relevant to but not central to the matter under discussion, limited experimental and spectral data, and crystallographic data.}
 %For footnotes in the main text of the article please number the footnotes to avoid duplicate symbols. e.g.  \footnote[num]{your text} the corresponding author \ast counts as footnote 1, ESI as footnote 2, e.g. if there is no ESI, please start at [num]=[2], if ESI is cited in the title please start at [num]=[3] etc. Please also cite the ESI within the main body of the text using \dag.
