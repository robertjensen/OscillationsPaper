\begin_layout Title
Response to reviewers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Reply to referees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are sorry that referee 1 did not like the paper, however, it has never
 been our intention to do a thorough review of the field but mere to report
 our findings in a system of size-selected nanoparticles deposited in a
 clean environment.
 We believe that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu-$
\end_inset

reactor platform is a extremely useful tool for characterizing model catalysts
 with high sensitivity and fast temperature response.
 We do also, however, acknowledge that this type of platform have significant
 challenges ahead for characterization of the particles, as commented by
 referee 1, and are currently working to gain insight into the particle
 morphology both in-situ and post mortem of the catalyst.
 We hope that the corrections we have done to the manuscript according to
 the points from referee 2 also meets some of referee 1's wishes for improvement
 of the manuscript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are very pleased that referee 3 likes that manuscript and hope that the
 referee will also like the revisions in this version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Reply to specific questions from referee 2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The refeere is requesting a broader literature list covering more of the
 literature.
 We acknowledge this and have added more references to the introduction.
 Several of the mentioned references by the referee are now included in
 the paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please find our comments to the specific questions below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
i) Regarding the use of the word ignition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The authors acknowledge the comment by the referee
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The manuscript has been revised to use the term more appropriately in this
 context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ii) Comment of the structural change of the particles during reaction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We are very much aware that the particles might show structural changes
 during the oscillation cycle.
 However, the fact that the conversion rate is unchanged during very long
 timescales does lead us to believe that it not a likely scenario.
 Notice that the oscillations are reproducible on a quite large variety
 of sizes which we believe also points against a structural change as the
 primary oscillation mechanism.
 This does not mean that particles do not change shape during the cycle,
 more that we do not expect this to be the cause of the oscillations or
 the increasing oscillation period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The manuscript has been revised according to the referee's point to make
 this more clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
iii) Comment of acquiring TEM images of nanoparticles 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While TEM is not entirely impossible it is very difficult to get images
 under reaction conditions, because the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu-$
\end_inset

reactor platform is not well suited for TEM due to the SiO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

substrate thickness of several hundred 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m.
 We have tried to mechanically break reactors in the hope that small fragments
 of SiO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 will extend out in to the vacuum and allow imaging of particles that might
 be positioned on these fragments.
 However, this is very time consuming and has so far not succeeded in giving
 us good images of nanoparticles after the reaction.
 As-deposited images are not difficult to get since they can be deposited
 on substrates more suitable for TEM.
 This would, however, not bring any insight into possible morphology change
 during reaction conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As response to the referee's comment we have added a TEM image of a particle
 deposited on a substrate similar to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu-$
\end_inset

reactor in the supplementary information along with the same explanation
 as given in this reply as to why TEM is extremely difficult on samples
 after the experiments are performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
iv) Regarding the facet change of the nanoparticles during reaction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We acknowledge the comment made by the referee but do not expect facets
 to be the driving mechanisms for the oscillations (see answer to question
 ii)) basically because we will then expect a much more pronounced size
 dependence of the oscillations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v) Regarding comparison with microkinetic modeling in the mentioned reference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We agree that a comparison between the microkinetic modeling and experimental
 study is interesting.
 The model mentioned in ref.
 12 (ref.
 19 in the revised manuscript) is a Monte Carlo simulation on a system quite
 similar to the system we present here.
 However, one of the main results of the paper is a prediction of the smallest
 nanoparticle size that will be able to show stable oscillations.
 This size is predicted to be 4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

nm which is well above the 3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

nm which are the size used for most of our results.
 This points towards some sort of discrepancy in the underlying mechanisms
 in our system and the theoretically modeled system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We do, however, believe a detailed discussion of the differences between
 the two systems are outside the scope of the current paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
vi) Comment on isotherms during reaction 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A very valid point made by the referee.
 We are ourselves are very much in doubt whether the reaction is isothermal
 on a microscopic level.
 On one hand the free energy pr.
 reaction is quite large and possibly distributed on a rather small amount
 of nanoparticles.
 On the other hand, heat transport in a small volume at 1bar should be very
 efficient.
 As mentioned in the paper, we have done several attempts at observing a
 possible sign for local temperature effects but so far without results.
 Thus one so far has to conclude that the experimental results points towards
 constant temperature also at the microscopic level but we are not confident
 enough in this yet to draw solid conclusions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The manuscript has been revised to make this point more clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
vii) Question regarding measurement of the O
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

/CO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

ratio in the reactor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
viii) Comment regarding the synchronization of the oscillations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We believe that even though we suggest a surface effect as the responsible
 mechanism for the oscillations the gas phase can still act as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

synchronizer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because the changing gas-composition will collectively either oxidize or
 reduce the particles through the oscillation cycle.
 Also, it should be noticed that for a given sample the temperature windows
 which shows oscillations is rather small indicating that the synchronization
 is not very robust but depends on rather careful parameter tuning.
