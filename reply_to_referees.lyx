Reply to referees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are sorry that referee 1 did not like the paper, however it has never
 been our intention to do a thorough review of the field, but to report
 our findings in a system of size-selected nanoparticles deposited in a
 clean environment.
 We hope that the corrections we have done to the manuscript according to
 the construtive suggestions from referee 2 also meets some of referee 1's
 whishes for improvement of the manuscript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are very pleased that referee 3 likes that manuscript and hope that the
 referee will also like the revisions in this version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Reply to specific questions from referee 2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We thank for the suggestions of adding more references to the introduction.
 Several of the mentioned references are now included in the paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please find our comments to the specific questions below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
i) We are sorry for the confusing use of the word ignition, the manuscript
 has been revised to use terms more appropriate in this context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ii) We are very much aware that the particles might show structural changes
 during the oscillation cycle.
 However, the fact that the conversion rate is unchanged during very long
 timescales does lead us to believe that it not a likely scenario.
 Notice that the oscillations are reproducible on a quite large variety
 of sizes which we believe also points against a structural change as the
 primary oscillation mechanism.
 This does not mean that particles do not change shape during the cycle,
 more that we do not expect this to be the cause of the oscillations or
 the increasing oscillation period.
 The manuscript has been revised to make this point more clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
iii) While TEM is not entirely impossible, it is very difficult to get images
 under realistic conditions, because the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu-$
\end_inset

reactor platform is not well suited for TEM due to the substrate thickness
 of several hundred 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m.
 We have tried to mechanically break reactors in the hope that small fragments
 of SiO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 will extend out in to the vacuum and allow imaging of particles that might
 be positioned on these fragments.
 However, this is very time consuming and has so far not succeeded in giving
 us good images of nano-particles after reaction.
 As-deposited images is not difficult to get, since they can be deposited
 on substrates more suitable for TEM, however this would not bring any insight
 into possible morphology change during reaction conditions.
 In the revised manuscript, we have added a TEM image of a particle deposited
 on a substrate similar to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu-$
\end_inset

reactor in the supplementary information along with the same explanation
 as given in this reply as to why TEM is extremely difficult on samples
 after the experiments are performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
iv) Similar to the answer for question ii) we do not expect facets to be
 the driving mechanisms for the oscillations, basically because we will
 then expect a much more pronounced size dependence of the oscillations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
v) The model mentioned in ref.
 12 (ref.
 19 in the revised manuscript) is a Monte Carlo simulation on a system quite
 similar to the system we present here.
 However, one of the main results of the paper is a prediction of the smallest
 nano particle size that will be able to show stable oscillations.
 This size is predicted to be 4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

nm which is well above the 3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

nm which are the size used for most of our results.
 This points towards some sort of discrepancy in the underlying mechanisms
 in our system and the theoretically modeled system.
 A detailed discusion of the differences between the two systems are properly
 outside of the scope of our paper.

vi) We are ourselves very much in doubt whether the reaction is iso-thermal
 on a microscopic level.
 On one hand the free energy pr.
 reaction is quite large and possibly distributed on a rather small amount
 of nanoparticles.
 On the other hand heat transport in a small volume at 1bar should be very
 efficient.
 As mentioned in the paper, we have done several attempts at observing a
 possible sign local temperature effects, so far without results.
 Thus one so far has to conclude that the experimental results points towards
 constant temperature also at the microscopic level, but we are not confident
 enough in this yet to draw solid conclusions.
 The manuscript has been revised to make this point more clear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
vii) We believe that even though we suggest a surface effect as the responsible
 mechanism for the oscillations, the gas phase can still act as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

synchronizer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because the changing gas-composition will colllectively either oxidize
 or reduce the particles through the oscillation cycle.
 Also one should notice that for a given sample, the temperature windows
 which shows oscillations, is rather small, showing that the synchronization
 is not very robust but depends on rather carefull parameter tuning.
