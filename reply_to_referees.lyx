It is indeed correct, that no charecterization of nano-particles.
 In situ-charecterization is unfortunately not possible in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu-$
\end_inset

reactor platform.
 It is also correct that the explanation of the osciallations is inspired
 by litterature and not by direct evidence from the results.
 However, we do believe that mass spectrometer data found in this study
 is an addition to the existing data in litterature and thus it is our belive
 that our study provides further experimental support of the existing model
 first proposed in ref.
 3.

i) We are sorry for the confusing use of the word ignition, the manuscript
 has been revised to use terms more appropriate in this context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ii) We are very much aware that the particles might show structural changes
 during the oscillation cycle.
 However, the fact that the conversion rate is unchanged during very long
 timescales does lead us to belive that it not a likely scenario.
 Notice that the oscillations are reproduceble on a quite large varity of
 sizes which we belive also points againts a structual change as the primary
 oscillation mechanism.
 This does not mean that particles do not change shape during the cycle,
 more that we do not expect this to be the cause of the oscillations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
iii) While TEM is not entirely impossible, it is very difficult to get images
 under realistic conditions, because the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu-$
\end_inset

reactor platform is not well suited for TEM due to the substrate thickness
 of several hundred 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

m.
 We have tried to mechanically break reactors in the hope that small fragments
 will SiO
\begin_inset Formula $_{2}$
\end_inset

 will extend out in to the vacuum and allow imaging of particles that might
 be positioned on these fragments.
 However, this is very time consuming and has so far not succeeded in giving
 us good images of nano-particles after reaction.
 As-deposited images is not difficult to get, since they can be deposited
 on substrates more suitable for TEM, howewer this would not bring any insight
 into possible morphology change during reaction conditions.

\begin_layout Standard
iv) Similar to the answer for question ii) we do not expect facets to be
 the driving mechanisms for the oscillations, basically because we will
 then expect a much more pronounced size dependence of the oscillations.

vi) We are ourselves vey much in doubt whether the reaction is iso-thermal
 on a microscopic level .
 On one hand the free energy pr.
 reaction is quite large and possibly distriuted on a rather small amount
 of nanoparticles.
 On the other hand heat transport in a small volume at 1bar should be very
 efficient.
 As mentioned in the paper, we have done several attempts at observing a
 possible sign local temperature effects, so far without results.
 Thus one so far has to conclude that the experimental results points towards
 constant temperature also at the microscopic level, but we are not confident
 enough in this yet to draw solid conclusions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
vii) We belive that even though we suggest a surface effect as the responsible
 mechanism for the oscillations, the gas phase can still act as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

synchronizer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because the changing gas-composition will colllectively either oxidize
 or reduce the particles through the oscillation cycle.
 Also one should notice that for a given sample, the temperature windows
 which shows oscillations, is rather small, showing that the synchronization
 is not very robust but depends on rather carefull parameter tuning.
